## Module Base Plate

Once you’ve explored the PicoBricks modules, you may want to use some of them in a project. Although PicoBricks is compact, there’s no need to build the entire thing into your project. By detaching the PicoBricks modules, you can connect just the modules you need using cables with standard, easy-to-use Grove connectors.

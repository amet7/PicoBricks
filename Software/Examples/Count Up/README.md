## Count Up Project Details

With this project, you use a servo to count from 0 to 60 seconds. The arrow on the servo moves 3 degrees every second.
You could use this project to make a game clock or stopwatch. You use the button to stop the clock.
You can let it count down instead of up with a slight modification.
With the block 30+(i/3) it will count up. When using block 30-(i/3) it will count down.

If you change the range block from -90 to 90 to 90 to -90 the arrow will go the other way.

How could you make this nicer? 

Think about :

* Add a bigger button
* Add a bigger OLED screen
* Flash the LED every second
* Use the RGB LED and change the color every second
* Draw a nice "clock" face. The servo is a 180-degree servo so you can not go a full circle
* Make fancier/funnier arrows to use.
* Use the same button to start and stop the count.

Use your imagination...

## Magic 8 Ball Project Details

Created by PeterMathijssen

This project could be the basis for a school project. 

It is based upon the classic Magic 8 Ball game.

Rules: Ask your PicoBricks a question and then press the button...

How could you make this nicer? 

Think about :

* Add a bigger button

* Add a bigger OLED screen

* Add more LEDs

* Make fancier/funnier sentences

* Build a magician that waves his arms with the help of servos and then displays the message.

Use your imagination...

## Pain Scale Project Details

Created by PeterMathijssen

In healthcare, there are patients who have problems verbally expressing their pain. 
Sometimes being only able to use a single finger. With this project, you could develop a system where patients could alert someone when their pain goes beyond a certain level.
It uses a PicoBricks button, an OLED screen, and a buzzer.
In this sample, the blocks for the buzzer are added but not used. As a nurse, you could "talk" to your patient and decide together when help is needed and whether the buzzer should make a noise or the message should get sent. 
Think about adding a bigger button, a bigger OLED screen, a WIFI module, or a Bluetooth module so you can send an alert to a nurse. There is no casing for this project so you could also think about that.

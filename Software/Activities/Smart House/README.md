## Smart House Project Details
Workplaces, factories, homes and even animal sheltersâ€¦ There are different electronic systems that can be used to protect our living spaces against intruders. These systems are produced and marketed as home and workplace security systems. There are systems where the images produced by security cameras are processed and interpreted, as well as security systems that detect the human body and its movements with sensors and take action. Security systems are set up like a kind of alarm clock and give audible and visual warnings when an unidentified activity is detected in the specified time zone. It notifies the business or the home owner, and it can also make automatic notifications to the security units. Gas leakage, fire etc. in such cases, gas sensors are used in homes and workplaces to prevent poisoning. In a negative situation, people living in the environment are warned by giving a loud alarm. We will prepare a model smart home project with PicoBricks using the HC-SR501 and MQ-2 gas sensor. This sensor HC-SR501, also known as PIR sensor, detects motion by capturing the changes of infrared waves reflected by the human body.  
When the HC-SR501 PIR sensor detects motion, it gives digital output for 3 seconds. We will use a Picoboard, buzzer and button LED module in the project. All parts must be in the model. When Picobricks starts, the button must be pressed to activate the alarm system. After pressing the button, we must wait 3 seconds for the hand to be pulled out of the model. At the end of 3 seconds, the red LED lights up and the alarm system is activated. When the alarm system detects a movement, the red LED will start to flash and the buzzer will sound the alarm. To mute it, Picobricks must be restarted.The MQ-2 sensor is always on. When it detects a toxic gas, it will notify you with a buzzer and red LED.

## Construction Stages of the Project

To run the project, you have to turn a cardboard box into a model house. You will need scissors, pencils, tape, glue, and a utility knife. Draw windows and doors on the box with a pencil. Cut the door section with a utility knife.

You can use another cardboard to make the roof part.

Attach double-sided foam tape under the picobricks pieces.

Place pieces of Picobricks inside the model house. Position the PIR sensor to see the door directly from the inside. attach the button module just above the door from the inside.

When you connect the battery case to Picoboard and turn it on, the code will start to run. 3 seconds after pressing the button, the alarm system will be activated and the red LED will turn on. As soon as you put your hand in the door, the buzzer will start to sound.

When you hold the lighter gas inside the house, the alarm system is expected to be activated again.

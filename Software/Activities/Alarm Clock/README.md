## Alarm Clock Project Details
Global warming is affecting the climate of our world worse every day. Countries take many precautions and sign agreements to reduce the effects of global warming. The use of renewable energy sources and the efficient use of energy is an issue that needs attention everywhere, from factories to our rooms. Many reasons such as keeping road and park lighting on in cities due to human error, and the use of high energy consuming lighting tools reduce energy efficiency. Many electronic and digital systems are developed and programmed by engineers to measure the light, temperature and humidity values of the environment and ensure that they are used only when needed and in the right amounts.

In this project, we will create a timer alarm that adjusts for daylight using the light sensor in Picobricks. In this project we will make a simple alarm application. The alarm system we will design is designed to sound automatically in the morning. For this, we will use LDR sensor in the project..At night, the OLED screen will display a good night message to the user, in the morning, an alarm will sound with a buzzer sound, a good morning message will be displayed on the screen, and the RGB LED will light up in white for light notification. The user will have to press the button of Picobricks to stop the alarm. After these processes, which continue until the alarm is stopped, when the button is pressed, the buzzer and RGB LED will turn off and a good day message will be displayed on the OLED screen.

## Smart Greenhouse Project Details
The rapid changes in climate due to the effect of global warming cause a decrease in productivity in agricultural activities. In the 1500s, Daniel Barbaro built the first known greenhouse in history. Greenhouses are suitable environments for growing plants that can provide controllable air, water, heat and light conditions. In greenhouses, heaters are used to balance the heat, electric water motors for irrigation, fans are used to regulate humidity and to provide pollination. With the development of technology, the producer can follow the status of the greenhouse with his phone from anywhere and can do the work that needs to be done. The general name of this technology is Internet of Things (IOT). Special sensors are used to measure temperature, humidity and oxygen content in greenhouses. In addition, special sensors measuring soil moisture are used to decide on irrigation. Electronically controlled drip irrigation systems are used to increase irrigation efficiency. In this project, we will prepare a simple greenhouse with IOT technology and PicoBricks. We will use PicoBricks with the ESP8266 wifi module in this greenhouse. In this way, we will turn the greenhouse into an object that we can track over the Internet. 

The greenhouse model you will prepare will include a soil moisture sensor, and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor hanging from the top. A submersible pump will be placed in the water tank outside the model, and the hose coming out of the end of the pump will go to the ground in the greenhouse. Picoboard will be placed in a suitable place outside the greenhouse model. When Picobricks starts, it starts to broadcast wifi thanks to the ESP8266 wifi module. When we enter the IP address of Esp8266 from the smart phone connected to the same network, we encounter the web page where we will control the Greenhouse. Here we can see the temperature and humidity values. If we wish, we can start the irrigation process by giving the irrigation command.

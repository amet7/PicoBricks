## Blink Project Details
In real life, the employee, who has just started to learn the job, first undertakes the most basic task.The cleaner first learns to use the broom, the cook learns to use the kitchen utensils, the waiter to carry a tray. We can increase these examples. The first code written by newcomers to software development is known as “Hello World”. Printing “Hello World” as soon as the program starts on the screen or console window in the language they use is the first step in programming. Like a baby starting to crawl… The first step to robotic c oding, also known as physical programming, is the Blink application. It means winking at robotic coding. By simply connecting an LED to the circuit board, the coding is made to keep the LED blinking continuously. Ask people who have developed themselves in the field of robotic coding how they got to this level. The answer they will give you starts like this; it all started with a flashing LED! LEDs are the language of electronic devices. Thanks to the LEDs, the programmer tells the users at which stage of the task the device is, what the problem is, if any, and which options are active. In this project, you will learn the types of LEDs on it with Picobricks and learn how to flash them. 
 There are 1 x 5mm red LED and 1 x WS2812B RGB LED on Picobricks. While normal LEDs can light up in one color, RGB colors can light up in different colors, both primary and secondary colors. In this project we will use the red LED on Picobricks. In the project, we will write the necessary codes to turn on the red LED on Picobricks, turn it off after a certain time, turn it on again after a certain time, and repeat these processes continuously.
